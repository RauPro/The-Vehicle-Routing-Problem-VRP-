# Implementation Complete ✅

## Greedy Nearest Neighbor Baseline Algorithm

The baseline "Greedy" algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem has been successfully implemented, tested, and documented.

## What Was Built

### ✅ Algorithm Implementation
A complete Greedy Nearest Neighbor algorithm that:
- Assigns orders to vehicles using a nearest neighbor heuristic
- Distributes orders across vehicles using round-robin selection
- Calculates total route distances with multiple unit support
- Provides comprehensive solution summaries
- Handles edge cases and validates inputs

### ✅ Core Functionality
- **`GreedyNearestNeighbor` class** with three main methods:
  1. `solve(vehicles, orders)` - Assigns all orders to vehicles
  2. `calculate_total_distance(route)` - Computes route distance
  3. `get_solution_summary(routes, unassigned)` - Generates detailed metrics

### ✅ Algorithm Logic
```
For each vehicle (round-robin):
  1. Start from vehicle's current position
  2. Find nearest unassigned order pickup point
  3. Assign that order to the vehicle
  4. Update position to order's dropoff location
  5. Repeat until all orders assigned
```

### ✅ Testing
Comprehensive test suite with 15+ test cases:
- Single and multiple vehicle scenarios
- Single and multiple order scenarios
- Distance calculations in different units
- Round-robin distribution verification
- Edge case handling (empty inputs, etc.)
- Greedy selection verification

### ✅ Documentation
Four levels of documentation:
1. **`GREEDY_ALGORITHM_SUMMARY.md`** - Implementation overview and status
2. **`GREEDY_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`** - Quick start guide with examples
3. **`GREEDY_VISUAL_GUIDE.md`** - Visual explanations and diagrams
4. **`docs/greedy_algorithm.md`** - Comprehensive technical documentation

### ✅ Examples
Multiple demonstration files:
- **`main.py`** - Full demonstration with 5 orders and 2 vehicles
- **`example_greedy_baseline.py`** - Simple usage example
- Inline code examples in all documentation

## How to Use

### Quick Start

```python
from src.models import Order, Vehicle
from src.algorithms.greedy_nearest_neighbor import GreedyNearestNeighbor

# Create algorithm
algorithm = GreedyNearestNeighbor(distance_unit='km')

# Prepare data
vehicles = [Vehicle("V1", 40.7128, -74.0060)]
orders = [Order("O1", 40.7580, -73.9855, 40.7614, -73.9776)]

# Solve
routes, unassigned = algorithm.solve(vehicles, orders)

# Get metrics
summary = algorithm.get_solution_summary(routes, unassigned)
print(f"Distance: {summary['total_distance']} km")
```

### Run Demonstrations

```bash
# Full demonstration
python3 main.py

# Simple example
python3 example_greedy_baseline.py

# Run tests
python3 -m pytest test_greedy_algorithm.py -v
```

## Performance

### Complexity
- **Time**: O(v × o²) where v=vehicles, o=orders
- **Space**: O(v + o)

### Characteristics
- ✅ Fast for small/medium problems (< 100 orders)
- ✅ Simple and easy to understand
- ✅ Good baseline for comparison
- ⚠️ Produces locally optimal (not globally optimal) solutions
- ⚠️ No backtracking or optimization
