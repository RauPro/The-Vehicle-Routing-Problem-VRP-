## Test 1: Data Structures ✓

### Purpose
Verify that objects store data correctly and methods return expected values.

### Test Cases

#### Order Object
```python
my_order = Order(
    id="TEST_ORDER_001",
    pickup_lat=40.7128,
    pickup_lon=-74.0060,
    dropoff_lat=40.7589,
    dropoff_lon=-73.9851
)
```

**Verified:**

- ✓ Pickup coordinates: `(40.7128, -74.0060)`
- ✓ Dropoff coordinates: `(40.7589, -73.9851)`
- ✓ `get_pickup_coordinates()` returns correct tuple
- ✓ `get_dropoff_coordinates()` returns correct tuple
- ✓ String representation is human-readable

#### Vehicle Object
```python
my_vehicle = Vehicle(
    id="TEST_VEHICLE_001",
    current_lat=40.7128,
    current_lon=-74.0060
)
```

**Verified:**

**Expected:** ~5-6 km  
**Actual:** **5.31 km** ✓  
**Result:** ✅ PASS

#### Test 2.4: Wrapper Function
**Test:** `calculate_distance()` vs `haversine_distance()`  
**Expected:** Both should return identical values  
**Actual:** 
- Wrapper: 5.31 km
- Direct: 5.31 km

**Result:** ✅ PASS

#### Test 2.5: Multiple Units
**Coordinates:** `(40.7128, -74.0060)` to `(40.7580, -73.9855)`

**Results:**
- Kilometers: **5.31 km** ✓
- Miles: **3.30 miles** ✓
- Meters: **5314.52 m** ✓
- Feet: **17436.10 ft** ✓

**Conversion Verification:**
- km to miles: ✓ (ratio ~0.621)
- km to meters: ✓ (ratio = 1000)

**Result:** ✅ PASS

## Test 3: Greedy Algorithm ✓

### Purpose
Create a tiny fixed dataset, manually calculate expected results, and verify algorithm produces correct output.

### Test Dataset

#### Vehicles (2)
```
V1: (40.7128, -74.0060)  # Lower Manhattan
V2: (40.7580, -73.9855)  # Times Square
```

#### Orders (4)
```
O1: Pickup (40.7130, -74.0055) -> Dropoff (40.7150, -74.0040)  # Very close to V1
O2: Pickup (40.7582, -73.9850) -> Dropoff (40.7600, -73.9840)  # Very close to V2
O3: Pickup (40.7300, -74.0000) -> Dropoff (40.7320, -73.9990)  # Between, closer to V1
O4: Pickup (40.7500, -73.9900) -> Dropoff (40.7520, -73.9890)  # Between, closer to V2
```

### Manual Calculation
