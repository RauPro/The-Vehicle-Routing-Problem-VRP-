## What Was Tested

### 1. Data Structures ✓

**Test Method:** Instantiate objects and verify data storage

**Order Object:**
```python
my_order = Order(
    id="TEST_ORDER_001",
    pickup_lat=40.7128,
    pickup_lon=-74.0060,
    dropoff_lat=40.7589,
    dropoff_lon=-73.9851
)
print(my_order)  # Output: Order(TEST_ORDER_001: [40.7128, -74.006] -> [40.7589, -73.9851])
```

**Verified:**
- ✓ ID, coordinates stored correctly
- ✓ Methods return expected tuples
- ✓ String representation is clear

**Vehicle & Route:** Similar verification completed successfully.

### 2. Distance Functions ✓

**Test Method:** Calculate distances with known coordinates and verify against online calculators

**Key Tests:**
```python
# Test 1: Identical points
distance = haversine_distance((40.7128, -74.0060), (40.7128, -74.0060))
assert distance == 0.0  # ✓ PASS

# Test 2: New York to Los Angeles
distance = haversine_distance((40.7128, -74.0060), (34.0522, -118.2437))
# Expected: ~3936 km, Actual: 3935.75 km ✓ PASS

# Test 3: Short distance (Lower Manhattan to Times Square)
distance = haversine_distance((40.7128, -74.0060), (40.7580, -73.9855))
# Actual: 5.31 km ✓ PASS (reasonable for NYC)
```

**Verified:**
- ✓ Zero distance for identical points
- ✓ Accurate long-distance calculation (verified vs NOAA calculator)
- ✓ Reasonable short-distance calculation
- ✓ All units work correctly (km, miles, meters, feet)

### 3. Greedy Algorithm ✓

**Test Method:** Create tiny fixed dataset (2 vehicles, 4 orders), manually calculate expected results, compare with algorithm output

**Test Dataset:**
```
Vehicles:
  V1: (40.7128, -74.0060)  # Lower Manhattan
  V2: (40.7580, -73.9855)  # Times Square

Orders:
  O1: Very close to V1
  O2: Very close to V2
  O3: Between, closer to V1
  O4: Between, closer to V2
```

**Manual Calculation:**
```
Round 1:
  V1 → O1 (nearest: 0.0477 km)
  V2 → O2 (nearest: 0.0476 km)

Round 2:
  V1 → O3 (nearest: 1.7016 km from O1 dropoff)
  V2 → O4 (only remaining: 1.2214 km from O2 dropoff)

Expected Result:
  V1 → [O1, O3]
  V2 → [O2, O4]
```

**Algorithm Output:**
```
V1 → ['O1', 'O3']  ✓ MATCHES
V2 → ['O2', 'O4']  ✓ MATCHES
```

**Verified:**
- ✓ Route assignments match manual calculation exactly
- ✓ Order sequences follow greedy nearest neighbor logic
- ✓ All orders assigned (none unassigned)
- ✓ Round-robin distribution works correctly
- ✓ Distance calculations are accurate
