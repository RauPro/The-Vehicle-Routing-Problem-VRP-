  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"vehicles":[{"id":"V1","current_lat":37.7749,"current_lon":-122.4194}],"orders":[{"id":"O1","pickup_lat":37.7849,"pickup_lon":-122.4094,"dropoff_lat":37.7949,"dropoff_lon":-122.3994}],"algorithm":"greedy"}'

# 3. Check frontend

# Click "Solve Routes"
# Verify routes appear
```

If all pass: ✅ **YOU'RE READY!**

## 📋 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Backend won't start
**Check:**
- [ ] Virtual environment activated?
- [ ] Dependencies installed?
- [ ] Port 8000 available?

**Fix:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pkill -f uvicorn  # Kill any existing
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

### Issue: Frontend won't connect
**Check:**
- [ ] Backend running?
- [ ] Correct URL (http://localhost:8000)?
- [ ] CORS enabled?

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify backend
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Check browser console
# Look for network errors
```

### Issue: Map is blank
**Check:**
- [ ] Internet connection?
- [ ] Coordinates correct?
- [ ] Console errors?

**Fix:**
- Refresh page (Ctrl+R)
- Check console (F12)
- Verify coordinates format: [lat, lon]

### Issue: Routes don't appear
**Check:**
- [ ] API response successful?
- [ ] Valid data returned?
- [ ] Coordinates in range?

**Fix:**
- Check Network tab
